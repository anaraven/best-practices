There are two versions of ourselves: _me-today_ and _me-tomorrow_.

_Me-tomorrow_ is a great person. _Me-tomorrow_ will wake up early, meditate, eat a healthy breakfast, get early to the workplace, be very professional at work, go to the gym regularly, chat often with friends and family, and get into bed happy and just-a-little-bit tired. _Me-tomorrow_ is very organized, can plan and prepare for the future, and adapts easily.

I would like to be like _me-tomorrow_. But most of times I am more like _me-today_.

_Me-today_ is lazy. Wakes up late, eats junk food, drinks a lot of tea/coffee,sometimes smokes, gets distracted in the work, skips the gym, browses social media instead of meeting friends, watches TV instead of talking with the family, gets to the bed very late and does not sleep well.

"I really want to write my thesis, but today I'm not in the mood. I better do it tomorrow, when I'm more inspired".

The problem with the hard things of life is that they are _hard_, and we are tempted to delay them. This is especially true when we finished our classes and we must organize our own time. When we are students we are forced to follow a schedule that someone else organized for us. We do not need to think "what should I do now". We just have to be in the classroom on time.

That is the first role of a calendar. It is the way that _me-tomorrow_ sends instructions to _me-today_.
